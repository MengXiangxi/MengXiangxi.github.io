        <h2>How I learnt...</h2>
        <p>This webpage answers the question of "How did you learn xxx?" I am willing to share the materials that helped me master the techniques, and please leave a message if you want to read about a specific area.</p>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>I learnt python when I was in Tianjin University, in late 2011 or early 2012, which is well before the deep learning era. At that time, the Lenovo laptop I was using was so lame that it literally took several minutes simply to load the the MATLAB program. One day I decided that I could not bear it anymore, and I had to take action to circumvent the hardware problem. Then I learnt Python, which helped a lot and became one of the major languages I master.</p>
        <p>As life is short, I just spent a weekend to get familiar with Python. I forgot the version, but it was certainly Python 2.x. The initial IDE I used was IDLE, but nowadays I use VSCode.</p>
        <p>The material I encountered in the very beginning was an early (but not that early?) version of <em>A Byte of Python</em> by <a href="https://swaroopch.com"  target="_blank">Swaroop C H</a>. The book is available online "open source" and is still being developed. A <a href="https://bop.mol.uno" target="_blank">Chinese translation</a> is also available. I recommend them to everyone who is new to Python.</p>
        <h4>Numpy and Scipy</h4>
        <p>I do not quite master numpy and scipy. I would be happy is anyone could offer me some advice on learning them.</p>
        <h4>Pandas</h4>
        <p>Pandas is a module that is almost essential to everyone who use Python in data science. I learnt pandas through a <a href="https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos" target="_blank">video series</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y" target="_blank">YouTube</a> by <a href="https://www.dataschool.io" target="_blank">Kevin Markham</a>.</p>

        <h3>MATLAB</h3>
        <p>MATLAB, a commercial software, offers a comprehensive library of technical support materials. I first used the software in high school, just to visualize some functions. I took a numerical calculation class in Tianjin University which introduced us to MATLAB. By then, I have also tried Mathematica, but I did not fall into it.</p>
        <p>I never formally learnt MATLAB, however, it is one of my major working languages. Just start do something, read codes by others, and google when you are confused.</p>

        <h3>Biomedical photonics</h3>
        <p>I never really received professional trainings on biomedical photonics, however it is one of the working areas of mine. The first biomedical photonics course I took was with late professor Huijuan Zhao from Tianjin University. She is one of the people who led me into the biomedical engineering field and I am very indebted to her. The course material was <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%8C%BB%E5%AD%A6%E5%85%89%E5%AD%90%E5%AD%A6.html?id=OMs-MwAACAAJ" target="_blank">《生物医学光子学》</a> by Kexin Xu, Feng Gao and Huijuan Zhao. The book was not very well received, and some people even called it 'poorly written'. However, it was at least very successful as the lecture notes, and is quite friendly to beginners.</p>
        <p>I then read <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470177013" target="_blank">Biomedical Optics: Principles and Imaging</a> by Lihong V. Wang and Hsin‐I Wu when I was in Emory and GATech. This book is important, fundamental, classical, yet obviously more advanced than the Chinese book.</p>

        <h3>LaTeX</h3>
        <p>I taught myself LaTeX in Nankai University. I forgot why I did this, maybe just to produce better typeset lab reports. I later joint the LaTeX user group in Tianjin University, where I learnt a lot from the talented senior students.</p>
        <p>There are various materials concerning the introduction of LaTeX, however, few are good enough. To Chinese users, I recommend <a href="https://item.jd.com/11258469.html" target="_blank">《LaTeX入门》</a> by my fellow student in Peking University, Haiyang Liu. This book enjoys a very good reputation and is often cited as 'the best introductory material for LaTeX in China'.</p>
        <p>Communities are significant in LaTeX culture. A special online community I join is the <a href="https://bbs.pku.edu.cn/v2/thread.php?bid=346&mode=single" target="_blank">Mathtools</a> board in BDWM BBS, the campus BBS of Peking University.</p>
