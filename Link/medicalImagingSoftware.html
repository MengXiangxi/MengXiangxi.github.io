        <h2>Review on medical imaging processing softwares for Windows</h2>
        <p>This is a review of medical imaging processing softwares that I use on my Windows 10 devices. Since I work with PET/CT and PET/MR images, this is from a perspective of a nuclear medical imaging researcher.</p>
        <p>All are FLOSS unless otherwise mentioned.</p>

            <p>MicroDicom is a light-weight visualizer of dicom images. It basically just show the image, plus a few essential functions, including window/level adjustment, and snapshot.</p>
            <p>I usually use Microdicom if I just want to go through the images, or I use it to explore the values of the dicom tags. I can load the dicom folder, and scroll through multiple dicom files, while observing the values for certain dicom fields.</p>

            <p>itk-SNAP is a very popular software among researchers, and it is one of my favorite. It is widely used for manual segmentation of 3D images. It also has a function of auto segmentation, but I have never used it.</p>
            <p>Apart from segmentation, itk-SNAP also provides users with other great features, including a registered multimodality display. It could also convert dicom files into other formats such as NIfTI.</p>
            <p>There are also a few things that itk-SNAP could use some improvement. One thing is that, it cannot generate MIP images.</p>

            <p>MIPAV is a popular tool for multiple biomedical images, and it has rich functionalities including image processing, analysis and visualization. Developed by NIH, it has many great features.</p>
            <p>However, I have not had a good experience with this Java-style software (which somehow reminds me of ImageJ). It seems that the product, so far, has not been optimized specifically for medical imaging.</p>

            <li><a href = "https://www.slicer.org/" target="_blank">Slicer</a></li>
            <p>I used 3DSlicer to process my first MRI image of myself so I understand that it is a nice tool for some certain image processing tasks, especially for daily routine, or as a platform for development. However, for simply visualizing and analyzing multimodality imaging data, 3DSlicer seems to be redundant and clumsy. It takes a much longer time just to load the data, and I have not found an appropriate extension to effectively process PET/CT data. Maybe Slicer is just for MRI people.</p>

        <li><a href = "https://jeffreyleal.wixsite.com/jleal" target="_blank">Imager-4D</a></li>
        <p>Imager-4D is a software specifically designed to visualize and process dynamic PET data. It seems that the authors are very ambitious to make the software into a fully functional platform for dynamic PET. For example, they even included the function for radiomics feature extraction, but it seems not to be working.</p>
        <p>However, the software is still in an infant stage, with many functions yet to be realized or optimized. It more seems like a beta version than a stable release. It has been time since the <a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10278-019-00255-7" target="_blank">corresponding paper</a> published, hopefully a second version will be out before long.</p>
